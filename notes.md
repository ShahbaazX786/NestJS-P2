## Introduction
1. Nestjs is for building efficient, scalable nodejs server side apps.
2. It uses progressive js, is built with and fully supports typescript.
3. It combines elements of OOPS, FP, and FRP(Function reactive programming).
4. Under the hood, Nest makes use of robust HTTP server frameworks like express(the default one). and optionally we can configure it to use fastify also.
5. When you think about it Express(is already a framework) and nest is a framework for a frameworkðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
6. But Why?
7. It is because express is a minimal framework that kind of gives you the syntax reduction and code splitting etc. But it doesn't give you a proper set of rules to do so.. 
8. That's why we can see every expressjs work is different in some way or the other.
